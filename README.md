## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is designed to detect gas leaks or the presence of alcohol using an MQ-2 gas sensor interfaced with an Arduino Uno microcontroller. It ensures safety through real-time monitoring and automated alerts using a buzzer (audible alert) and LED indicator (visual alert). The system is suitable for various applications including industrial safety, automotive safety systems, and personal safety devices.
